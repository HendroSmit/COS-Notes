# Session 2 — Death House (Upper Floors and Descent)

Use this template to prep and log the next session. It carries forward context and gives a quick-play checklist.

## Recap (from Session 1)

- Entered Daggerford on Highharvestide; accepted a job from the barkeep to investigate the “Death House.”
- Mists rolled in; the house appeared; door sealed behind us; Raven sensed evil and a humming below.
- Found: ominous riddle at 6 o’clock; hunting room with moving wolf décor; crossbows and five silvered bolts; Durst invitation; family portrait with missing-baby inscription.

## Timekeeping

- Shortly after 6 o’clock; the “beast” awakens at midnight (track time).

## Clues and Leads

- Secret room exists; something about an offering/gift (per the riddle).
- Humming from below suggests a lair/ritual site.
- Durst family secrets (portrait baby missing; invitation) are relevant.
- Expect servants/brood/animated guardians.

## Objectives

## Objectives

- Find the secret room and figure out the “gift.”
- Locate the source of the humming below.
- Map key rooms and gather evidence of the house’s threat.

## Highlights (player-facing)

- Dining Room: lavish feast laid out; sound of dinner vanished on approach.
- Kitchen/Pantry: largest knife missing; pantry cache found—Wizard of Wines “Champagne du le Stomp”, lace with “K,” dried brown powder, wilted sunflowers with note “For the light of my life. —G.” A kitchen knife later flew into the wall when the note was read.
- Upper Hall: windmill-cameo longsword; wolf-helmed suits of armor; cold draft from above.
- Servants’ Room: dumbwaiter answered the bell; laundry sent down returned folded — woman’s slip missing.
- Conservatory: “Waltz for Klara” discovered; playing it revealed a spectral dance (Elisabeth glaring; Gustav dancing with a humble young woman) and a scraping bookshelf across the hall.
- Library: letter from Klara; receipts for candles/daggers/incense; secret door opened.
- Secret Room: ominous tomes and a skeleton; Strahd letter found.
- Third-Floor Balcony: animated armor defeated — Gold thrown but lands on his feet; Raven tanks; Ori’s crossbow shot ends it.

## Notable Items

- Bottle: Champagne du le Stomp
- Lace with “K” monogram
- Vial of dried powder
- Wilted sunflowers + note signed “—G.”
- Receipts (candles, daggers, incense)

## Clues and Threads

- “K” and “—G” suggested by items and letters; Elisabeth’s jealousy seen in the vision.
- Windmill motif recurs (sword, plates, art); Durst ties.
- House responds to music: “Waltz for Klara” triggered the Library secret.
- Unseen household “servants” (dumbwaiter).
- Midnight riddle still looming.

## Next

- Continue the third floor; look for the master suite and more clues.
- Track time against midnight.
- Examine the secret room materials carefully; document findings.
