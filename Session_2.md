# Session 2 — Death House (Upper Floors and Descent)

Use this template to prep and log the next session. It carries forward context and gives a quick-play checklist.

## Recap (from Session 1)

- Entered Daggerford on Highharvestide; accepted a job from the barkeep to investigate the “Death House.”
- Mists rolled in; the house appeared; door sealed behind us; Raven sensed evil and a humming below.
- Found: ominous riddle at 6 o’clock; hunting room with moving wolf décor; crossbows and five silvered bolts; Durst invitation; family portrait with missing-baby inscription.

## Timekeeping

- Current time: shortly after 6 o’clock.
- Midnight event: the “beast” awakens. Track exploration time by room or scene.

## Clues and Leads

- Secret room implied by the riddle; requires a “gift.”
- Humming from below suggests a ritual site or lair.
- Portrait inscription omits a baby; Durst family secret likely relevant (nursery, study, or hidden records).
- Servants/brood warning—animated décor or summoned guardians.
- Invitation ties to Durst Mill anniversary; dining hall/study may hold context objects.

## Objectives

- Identify the secret room and determine the “gift.”
- Locate the source of the humming below.
- Map the first and second floors (mark locked doors, hazards, and curios).
- Gather proof of the Death House’s threat for payment—or a means to dispel it.
