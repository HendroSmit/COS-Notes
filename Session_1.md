# Session 1 — Death House (Arrival and First Floor)

Our characters were advanced to level 2. Quick descriptions:

## Ori

A fiery tiefling and wild magic sorcerer. She hasn’t quite found her place in the world and is fascinated by the infernal and the angelic. Her drive is knowledge—learning more about the world and perhaps curing the infernal blood in her veins. She’s mostly along for the ride so far, more at home in an adventuring party than anywhere else. Alignment: chaotic neutral.

## Gold Luck

A cavalier tabaxi—brash and perhaps overconfident—now a swashbuckler rogue. He’s the de facto leader and party face. Tiger stripes and ornate armor mask a fragile, insecure core. Alignment: true neutral; looks out for himself. Seeks redemption for past sins.

## Raven Blood

An aasimar paladin with an Oath of Vengeance. Her people were persecuted and fled their lands, and her family lived in relative peace until her sister—her last remaining family—was taken. She seeks justice for these wrongs and wields holy power granted by Tyr (though she does not yet know his name).

### Session summary (from Gold Luck’s perspective)

- We entered Daggerford on the eve of Highharvestide and ducked into a nearby tavern to rehash our misadventures in Neverwinter.

- In Neverwinter we were hired to intimidate a noble’s nephew—by a man named De Quad (we’ve been calling him “Dick Wad”). He wanted to ensure the nephew never spoke of the noble’s affair. Unfortunately, I (Gold Luck) had relations with the boy’s mother; when her husband arrived, I leapt from the window, grabbed the boy on the way, and dragged him down—impaling the poor soul on Raven’s spear below. We fled and headed to Daggerford to let things cool off.

- The barkeep—a rotund fellow with a grand ginger moustache—approached and asked if we were “rough-and-tumble types.” He offered drinks and 10 gp each to investigate a local haunted house dubbed the “Death House,” which seems to have appeared from nowhere.

- Leaving the bar, a storm and thick mist rolled over the town. In the fog we found the Death House and entered. The door slammed shut. Raven shivered—she sensed great evil in the walls and a horrid humming beneath our feet.

- We found a family portrait whose inscription seems to omit a baby present in the painting. Odd.

- At six o’clock, with a harsh toll and a nails-on-slate screech, a bloody message scrawled itself across the wall:

  Beneath this dwelling lurks a beast
  Who hungers for a bloody feast.
  He sleeps until the midnight chime
  Then wakes to feed his dark design.
  If morsels seek to flee their doom,
  Then bring toward his secret room
  A gift to soothe his savage mood
  But mind the servants of his brood.

- We did not panic. Mostly.

- West room: a hunting lounge. Old toys. The wolf décor seemed to move when not observed.

- We armed up: Raven took a heavy crossbow, Ori a light crossbow, and I took a hand crossbow. We found several bolts, five of which were silvered.

- In the cloakroom, an invitation in a coat pocket read:
  You are cordially invited to join
  MR. GUSTAV & ELISABETH DURST
  for a celebration of the one-year anniversary of the Durst Mill.
  The Durst Residence, Barovia Village
  6 o’clock p.m.
  13 Neyavr, 348
  Dinner and refreshments to be served.

END OF SESSION

## Clues and Leads

- The house: Appeared amid a storm and mist; front door sealed on entry. Raven senses a malign presence and a humming below (possible basement/ritual site).
- The portrait: Inscription seems to omit a baby visible in the painting—suggests a hidden/erased family history detail (Durst family secret?).
- The riddle (triggered at 6 o’clock):
  - “Beast” awakens at midnight → time pressure; track hours.
  - “Bring toward his secret room a gift” → there is a secret room; some offering might pacify or grant access.
  - “Mind the servants of his brood” → expect minions/guardians (the moving wolf décor could be related).
- The invitation:
  - Hosts: Mr. Gustav & Elisabeth Durst; venue: The Durst Residence, Barovia Village; event: 1-year anniversary of the Durst Mill; date/time: 6 p.m., 13 Neyavr, 348.
  - Confirms the house’s ownership and ties to the Dursts; may hint at important rooms (dining, study, nursery, mill memorabilia).
- Equipment: Raven (heavy crossbow), Ori (light), Gold (hand). Bolts found; five are silvered—keep for resistant foes.

Open questions

- What is the “gift” the beast requires? Where is the secret room?
- Who/what is the beast, and who are its “servants/brood”?
- Why is the baby omitted from the portrait inscription?
- What’s the significance of the humming below?
- Current time: just after 6 o’clock—how much exploration can we do before midnight?
