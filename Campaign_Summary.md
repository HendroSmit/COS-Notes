## Adventure Hook — Lost in the Mists

The party are mercenary adventurers hired to investigate a series of mysterious disappearances tied to a house known as the Death House. This hook focuses the party on Strahd’s tyranny and the suffering of Barovia’s people, encouraging immersion in the lore and relationships with its cast.

Deviation from the baseline: a barkeep in Daggerford offered the job to investigate the so‑called “Death House.” Otherwise, the hook proceeds as written.
